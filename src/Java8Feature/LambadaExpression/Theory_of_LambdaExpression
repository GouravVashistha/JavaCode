1. What is Lambda?
    It provides a clear and concise way to represent one method interface using an expression. It is very useful in collection library.
    It helps to iterate, filter and extract data from collection.

    Lambda is anonymous Function:-
        NO Name
        No modifier
        No Return Type

    The Lambda expression is used to provide the implementation of an interface which has functional interface. It saves a lot of code.
    In case of lambda expression, we don't need to define the method again for providing the implementation.
    Here, we just write the implementation code.

2. What is the Benefits of Lambda?
    -> Reduces the Line of Code.
    -> Sequential and Parallel Excution Support by passing behaviour as an argument in methods.
    -> To call APIs Very effectively.
    -> To write more Readable, Maintainable and concise code.
